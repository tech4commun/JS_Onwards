## JavaScript (JS)
It is a programming language.

### Need
Can we create a website of calculator using only HTML and CSS?
> No (we can just create structure & design), it cannot do mathematical operations because HTML & CSS are not programming languages.

> JS introduces brain to the website
- It helps in manipulating HTML and CSS
- Example: On clicking any text, it changes its style

### Interesting Facts about JS
- Development Time: only 10 days
- Browsers understand three things: HTML, CSS, JS

To understand (like a compiler) the syntax or instructions of JS, Chrome has the "V8 engine"

### Story Time:
**1995** - Netscape was a famous browser. At that time, everyone was thinking to add liveliness to websites and there was a man who developed JavaScript for this purpose in just 10 days.

> It was free and due to interactivity (due to the addition of JavaScript), it got a boom.

> Then came a company Microsoft. It had a web browser Internet Explorer. They enhanced JScript and made it free.

> The developers started facing problems because of two languages for the same thing: JS (by Netscape) and JScript (by Microsoft).

> Netscape went to ECMA (association to standardize things) to set up a standard like ES6, ES7, ES9.

> Due to funding issues, Netscape got dissolved.

> But Netscape made their browser code open source. Then a Mozilla company formed. They took the code, updated it, and launched Mozilla Firefox (open source).

Then Google Chrome came (it comes with V8 engine). It makes JS run very fast compared to Mozilla and Internet Explorer.

Currently: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari (by default)

After the success of V8, Mozilla came up with the Spider Monkey engine.

### JS Engine
- It converts JS code to Machine Code
- JS Engine is written in C++ (majorly 70%)

### Running JavaScript
```javascript
console.log("print statement")
```
```bash
node "d:\JS_Onwards\Day001\Brain.js"
hello
```
> Node here means MERN 'n' Node.js - we will explore in the future.

We want to run JS code also outside the browser (like in VS Code). For this came Node.js.

> (V8 engine + extra functionality) --> named it Node

Whoever installs Node to VS Code can run JS. (LTS - Long Term Support Node.js)

> When Node.js came with JS, it gave power to accommodate it in the backend.

### How do we store things?
> Three things: `let`, `const`, `var`
